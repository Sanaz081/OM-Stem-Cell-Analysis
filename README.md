The optical action potential durations (APDs) were assessed at 80% repolarization (APD80), and two-dimensional (2D) APD80 maps were generated to depict the spatial dispersion. Additionally, activation times (AT) at the peak of the derivative of voltage over time (dv/dt max) were quantified, and local conduction velocity (CV) was calculated according to previously described methods
